A hilarious spoof of [actuarial-lookup.com](http://www.actuarialoutpost.com/actuarial_discussion_forum/showthread.php?t=262572). I floated the idea in private messages, but now that DS and clarinetist have brought it out in the open I'd like to see how far the idea goes. My current thoughts are on using text-mining to determine which AO posters are the most compatible with each other. Feel free if you want to join in on this project, I'll add you as a collaborator. This will give you a good opportunity to get web-designing, text-mining, and project management experience! See [thread](http://www.actuarialoutpost.com/actuarial_discussion_forum/showthread.php?t=271505) for more information.
